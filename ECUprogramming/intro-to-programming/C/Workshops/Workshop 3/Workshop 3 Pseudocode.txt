Assessment 3

Robot Search Engine


Write Program Which uses STRUCTS POINTERS and ARRAYS to "search" and add to a DATABASE of ROBOTS to choose for the race determined by the relative SPEED score.

Typedef Struct and variables to be used in struct for ROBOT

Welcome User and print available robots

Allow User to choose if they would like to add a custom robot(Object to struct array) to the Table

If statement which chooses to build robot or not.

IF Build is true Run "Create Robot" Function and point result to array.

Else run the rest of the program.

Import Speed Function from previous Workshop and edit to suit task.

Run speed function which asks for INPUT 2 Variables (FinishTime (in seconds) & Distance (in Meters))

(If Variables not within acceptable parameters LOOP INPUT until parameters correct)

INPUT 1 Variable (INT) of STRENGTH (between 0-100)

(If Variables not within acceptable parameters LOOP INPUT until parameters correct)

Do Math Equation

OUTPUT Trial Speed score

Compare Speed Score with Preexisting Robots and omit Robots which are not high enough Speed Score

OUTPUT Remaining options

SET QUIT and RESET parameters using INT and LOOP Functions

TERMINATE PROGRAM
