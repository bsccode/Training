# Robot Wars Program

## Overview
This program simulates a Robot Wars competition, where robots participate in various tests to measure their speed, strength, and combat effectiveness. It allows users to create new robots, update information, simulate combats, and save results.

## Features
- **Robot Creation and Management**: Ability to create new robots and update their information.
- **Simulation**: Simulate robot performance in various tests.
- **Result Display and Storage**: Display current and past simulation results, and save them to a file.
- **Search and Display Functions**: Ability to search for specific robots and display their information.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler like GCC.
3. Run the executable to start the program.

## Usage
The program's menu offers various options:
- **Search Robot**: Search for a robot by its identifying number.
- **Update Robot Information**: Add a new robot to the competition.
- **Simulate Robot VS Human**: Simulate a combat between a robot and a human.
- **Display Latest Simulation Results**: View results of the last simulation.
- **Display Winners**: [Function currently unavailable]
- **Save Robot Information**: Save current robot information to a file.
- **Save All Results**: [Function currently unavailable]
- **Display All Current Robots**: Show details of all robots in the competition.
- **Exit**: Quit the program.

## File Structure
- `Robot.txt`: Stores individual robot information.
- `FightResult.txt`: Contains the results of combat simulations.
- `Results.txt` and `Winners.txt`: [Intended for future use]

## Development
This program is written in C and is compiled and run in a standard C environment. It uses file handling to store and retrieve information, and employs structured programming techniques.

## Limitations
- Certain features like "Display Winners" and "Save All Results" are not currently available.
- The program's combat simulation is based on random number generation and may not accurately reflect real-world combat capabilities.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please ensure to follow the existing code structure and comment your changes appropriately.

## License
This project is open source and available under [LICENSE NAME].

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing the unavailable features.
- Improving the combat simulation algorithm for more realistic results.
- Adding a graphical user interface for better user experience.
