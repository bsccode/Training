INTRO TO PROGRAMMING
Create a Game Using Classes and Objects
Welcome! You should now be equipped with everything you need to make a complicated program that uses multiple classes that interact with each other. This is where we turn the creativity over to you.

If you canâ€™t think of any ideas, here are some examples of systems that you could create.

Create a Pokemon-like game where your Classes could be different types of Creatures that can battle each other. You could create a system where you have a Trainer class that has multiple Creatures. You could create Items to use on those Creatures.

Create a Casino with multiple types of Games. You could then create a Player that has an amount of money that they can wager on the different Games you created.
Create a Store that has an inventory of food Items. You could then have a Shopper class that can purchase items from the Store.

Create a high school simulator. You could create a School class that can interact with Students, Teachers, and Courses. You could create a whole little world of different students taking different classes, where you could track things like their grades, favorite subjects, and friendships.
